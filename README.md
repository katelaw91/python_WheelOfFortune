# python_WheelOfFortune
A basic python Wheel of Fortune program including an AI opponent that I created based off some homework assignment that I had for Intro to Python.  (My first program ever!!!)

The story of this program:

    The homework assignment was titled 'Wheel of Fortune' and students were asked to write a program where you enter a phrase, and have it count the occurences of each letter.
    
    I observed that the assignment was incorrectly named in that case, and the teacher replied that I could make the actual Wheel of Fortune game.
    
    Thus I set out to recreate Wheel of Fortune.
    
    The first iteration was singleplayer, until I realized that single player Wheel of Fortune is pretty boring. So I decided to make an AI to face off with. 
    
    In iteration 2, The AI filled the phrase with random unguessed letters at first, but it didn't seem very lifelike because 'lpsn fn adfj' is never going to be 'less is more' nor is it really that funny. 
    
    For iteration 3 I had the AI pull words from the list of phrases the program could choose, but that AI didn't mess up enough to be believable. I guess I wanted to give the illusion that the english language was foreign to the AI, so it wouldn't know what wasn't a common phrase or not. 
    
    So for a more comedic effect, in the final iteration I gave added a list of similar words to throw it's guesses off, so it could guess things like 'haste makes paste' instead of waste. 
    
    **Note: I utilized concepts we had gone over in the class up until that point, it was an intro to python and really an intro to coding in general. My experience going into this was none.
